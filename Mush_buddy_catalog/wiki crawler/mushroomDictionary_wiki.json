  "description":"A large, conspicuous mushroom, Amanita muscaria is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development. Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage reveals a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil, which helps identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from globose to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens.[29] Fully grown, the bright red cap is usually around 8\u201320 cm (3\u20138 in) in diameter, although larger specimens have been found.

It is a small species rarely exceeding 5.5 cm (2\n+\n1\u20444 in) in height, with a cap usually smaller than an adult's fingernails: 0.5 to 2 cm (1\u20444 to 3\u20444 in)\u2014although it has been known to reach up to 4 cm (1\n+\n1\u20442 in).[26] It is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top.[26] The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. It becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown\u2013roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center.[18] It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity.[27] The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray.[13][27] Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.[28]",

  "description":"The cap of B. ananas is 33\u201374 mm (1.3\u20132.9 in) wide and plano-convex (flat on one side and rounded on the other). It is covered with squamules (small scales) that can be either pressed against the cap or curved back on itself. The squamules range in color from reddish brown to red-tan, to pink to pinkish gray, and they are more concentrated and more scaly in the center of the cap, extending out of cream to light orange-pink to light pink-red floccose ground. The margin clasps the stem when young; at maturity it separates into triangular veil remnants (appendiculae) that measure 6\u201312 by 3\u201310 mm. The color of these appendiculae range from buff-white to faint pink. The flesh is 2\u20133 mm thick at the edge of the cap, 7\u201310 mm over the tubes, and 11\u201318 mm centrally. It is buff white to light yellow, and quickly turns bluish upon exposure to air. The tubes are 1\u20135 mm long at the margin, 10\u201320 mm in the center, and 4\u20136 mm at the stem. They are broadly and deeply depressed around the stem, of irregular lengths, bright yellow to olive-yellow to mustard-yellow, and also rapidly turn blue upon exposure. The pores are the same color as the tubes, and rapidly turn blue-green with pressure; they are angular, and there are about 0.5\u20131.5 pores per mm. The stem is 53\u2013115 cm (20.9\u201345.3 in) by 6\u201314 mm (0.2\u20130.6 in) wide, and gradually becomes larger towards the base to 10\u201319 mm. The top part of the stem is cream to pink, the middle finely longitudinally striate, with the striations darkening with handling, red-lavender to brown-red, lighter with age. Immediately above the basal tomentum the stem surface is cream-colored with few striations. The basal tomentum is made of stiff, coarse white hairs over the lower 6\u201350 mm. The flesh of the stem is solid (i.e., not hollow) white to buff-tan to light yellow, and turns slightly blue with exposure.

The spore print is olive brown. The flesh of the fruit body is white, thick and firm when young, but becomes somewhat spongy with age. When bruised or cut, it either does not change colour, or turns a very light brown or light red.[33] Fully mature specimens can weigh about 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz); a huge specimen collected on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in 1995 bore a cap of 42 cm (16\n+\n1\u20442 in), with a stipe 18 cm (7 in) in height and 14 cm (5\n+\n1\u20442 in) wide, and weighed 3.2 kg (7 lb 1 oz).[30] A similarly sized specimen found in Poland in 2013 made international news.[34]",

The columns, which are narrower at the base than above, are reddish-orange above and yellowish-pink below. Young specimens have the fruit body compressed into the small interior space of an \"egg\",[11] which consists of a peridium that is surrounded by a gelatinous layer that encloses the compressed fruiting body. The egg, usually gray or grayish-brown,[11] typically reaches diameters of 3 to 5 cm (1.2 to 2.0 in) before the columns grow. The volva remains at the base of the fruit body as a thick, loose, whitish sack. The mycelial cords found at the base of the volva are made of two types of tissues: a central bundle of fine hyphae that extend in a longitudinal direction, and an outer cortical layer of coarser hyphae that form a loose but highly interwoven structure. Full-grown columns can extend to 5 to 8 cm (2.0 to 3.1 in) above the ground, a location that optimizes spore dispersal.

  "description":"The fruit body size of Coprinopsis lagopus can vary tremendously. This fungus gives rise to very small fruit bodies (known as dwarf fruit-bodies), some of which are less than one-hundredth the size of the larger ones. In a series of experiments, Arthur Henry Reginald Buller grew spores on horse dung and noted a large range of size variation: the smallest specimen having a stem length of 1 mm and cap diameter of 0.75 mm, while the largest specimen had a stem length of 18.4 cm (7\n+\n1\u20444 in) and cap diameter of 2 cm.[4] Buller noted that the dwarf fruit-bodies are fully functional, producing and liberating spores in a manner identical with normal ones. The great variation in size has led some authors to erroneously name the dwarf fruit-bodies as new species. For example, George Edward Massee considered the dwarfs to be a new species, Coprinus radiatus.[2] In general, dwarf fruit-bodies have stem lengths from 1\u201310 mm tall and cap of 0.75\u20133 mm in diameter, while large specimens have stems that are 5\u201318.5 cm (2\u20137\n+\n1\u20444 in) tall and 2\u20135 mm wide, with cap diameters of 2\u20135 cm (3\u20444\u20132 in).[5] The thickness of the stem in the larger specimens is typically 4\u20136 mm thick, up to 0.8 mm thick at the club-shaped or bulbous base.[6]",

The stipe is 5.5 to 11 centimetres (2\n+\n1\u20444 to 4\n+\n1\u20444 in) tall, and 0.5 to 1.5 centimetres (1\u20444 to 5\u20448 in) thick with a bulbous base. It is the same colour or slightly paler than the cap, and can have yellow fragments of the veil (cortina) attached to its lower half.[8] The flesh is cream or pale yellow, but more tan below the pileipellis and in the stem base. It smells slightly of radishes and has no strong taste.[9]",

It is dark violet to blue-black in colour, and is covered in fine, downy scales.[4] This layer on the cap is known as the pileipellis, which is either classified as a trichoderm\u2014parallel hyphae running perpendicular to the surface and forming a layer 6\u201322 \u00b5m wide\u2014or rarely an ixocutis, a layer of gelatinized hyphae 2\u201311 \u00b5m wide.[14] The cap surface, unlike that of many other Cortinarius species, is neither sticky nor slimy, though it is occasionally greasy.[14] The stipe, or stalk, is 6 to 18 cm (2\n+\n1\u20443 to 7 in) tall, and 1 to 2 cm (3\u20448 to 3\u20444 in) thick.[20] Due to its swollen, bulbous nature, the base of the stipe can sometimes be as wide as 4 cm (1\n+\n1\u20442 in). The stipe is a similar colour to the cap, and covered in wool-like fibrils;[4] purple mycelium can be present at the base.[21] Younger specimens feature a veil, but this vanishes quickly.[13] The flesh is violet, but darker below the pileipellis and in the stipe.[4] The flesh has a mild taste, indistinctly reminiscent of cedar wood, with a slight, pleasant smell, also reminiscent of cedar wood.[4][22] The gills are dark violet, changing to a purplish-brown with age.[4] They have an adnate connection to the stipe, and can be very dark in older specimens.[21] The mushroom stains red when in contact with potassium hydroxide (KOH).[14] Fruit bodies identified as C. v. hercynicus are less robust than those of the nominate subspecies.[21]",

The inner surface of the peridium (the endoperidium) is striated or grooved, and shiny. Young specimens have a lid, technically called an epiphragm, a thin membrane that covers the cup opening. The epiphragm is hairy like the rest of the exoperidial surface, but the hairs often wear off leaving behind a thin white layer stretched across the lid of the cup. As the peridium matures and expands, this membrane breaks and falls off, exposing the peridioles within.[14] The peridium is attached to its growing surface by a mass of closely packed hyphae called an emplacement; in C. striatus the maximum diameter of the emplacement is typically 8\u201312 mm, and often incorporating small fragments of the growing surface into its structure.[15] The species is inedible.[16]",

Microscopically, they are highly variable as well, though most species have spores that are ornamented, lack a germ pore, and have a plage. Many species also have characteristic tibiiform cystidia. However, there are many exceptions, and many species of Galerina lack one or more of these microscopic characteristics. Ecologically, all Galerina are saprobic, growing in habitats like rotting wood or in moss.[2]",

  "description":"This fungus is parasitic and saprophytic,[2] and grows as a mycelium within the wood of living and dead trees. The Ganoderma applanatum grows in single, scattered, or compound formations.[2] It forms fruiting bodies that are 3\u201330 cm wide \u00d7 5\u201350 cm long \u00d7 1\u201310 cm thick,[3] hard as leather, woody-textured, and inedible.[4] They are white at first but soon turn dark red-brown. The upper surface of the fruiting body is covered with reddish brown conidia. Brown spores are released from the pores on the underside of the fruiting body. The spores are highly concentrated, and as many as 4.65 billion spores can be dispersed from a 10-10cm section of the conk within 24 hours.[5] The tubes are 4\u201312 mm deep and terminate in pores that are round with 4\u20136 per millimetre.[3] The fruiting bodies are perennial, and may persist for multiple years, increasing in size and forming new layers of pores as they grow. These layers can be distinguished in a cross section or from observation of the concentric rings on the upper surface of the fruiting body.[6] This allows the fruiting body's age to be determined using the same method as tree rings.",

Initially, the fruiting body is egg-shaped\u2014similar in appearance to puffballs\u2014and has strands of mycelia (rhizomorphs) at the base that attach it to the growing surface. The 'skin,' or peridium, is composed of two separate layers: the outer layer (exoperidium), which is a golden tan to yellowish-brown color, separates away from the inner basidiocarp and splits into five to eight rays[3] that curve backward (recurve) to the base. The mushroom is 2 to 5 cm (3\u20444 to 2 in) in diameter after the rays have expanded. Unlike some other members of the genus Geastrum (such as G. fornicatum) the arms do not push the basidiocarp off the ground; rather, it lies flat. The inner spore-bearing basidiocarp is 0.5 to 2 cm (1\u20444 to 3\u20444 in) broad, and has a central pore surrounded by a circular dull-brown apical disc; the disc is distinctly ridged or depressed.[1] The inside of the interior sphere is white when young, but matures into a mass of brown, powdery spores mixed with thick-walled fibres known as capillitium.[4] The species is inedible.[5]",

  "description":"Like all mushrooms, the fruit body of Geastrum triplex is the visible part of a larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of nearly invisible fungal threads called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The fruit body\u2014created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal\u2014is designed to produce and disseminate spores. Geastrum triplex has the largest fruit body of the earthstar mushrooms.[14] The immature fruit body is typically 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2.0 in) in diameter, and up to 8 to 9 cm (3.1 to 3.5 in) broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5 cm)[13] after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the ostiole, covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is sessile) grayish brown to \"wood brown\" when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the gleba. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a columella not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited.[18]",

  "description":"The cap is from 3 to 10 cm in diameter, and pale to rusty brown in colour, which becomes darker with age. The stem is a similar colour, although it may be lighter at the apex. If the stem is cut vertically, it is usual to find several cavities of differing sizes inside. Both the cap and the stem have a tendency to crack or split in dry periods, or with age. The pores are small and white; they become dirtier with age, and are not attached to the stem. They darken slightly when pressed. The tubes are also whitish, and the spore print is pale yellow to straw. The flesh is firm,[1] and does not change colour on cutting. The photograph on the right shows the chunkier form; a slender form also occurs.",

Sometimes there is a central pimple, and the cap is typically coloured a greyish lilac, sometimes varying to a pale buff. It is thin fleshed, with an incurved margin in younger specimens. The stem measures between 25 and 65 millimetres in height, with a width between 4 and 12 millimetres. The cylindrical stem is typically widest at the bottom becoming narrower towards the top, or sometimes club shaped. The stem is concolorous with the cap, but sometimes is a little paler or with a yellowish hue. The stem is particularly soft and easily broken, and can become hollow. The flesh is buff. The gills are decurrent and crowded, and vary in colour from a pale yellowish to a pale flesh, turning to a greyish lilac with age.

Under appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity, and nutrient availability, the visible reproductive structures (fruit bodies) are formed. The cap of the fruit body, measuring between 5 and 15 cm (2.0 and 5.9 in) in diameter, is initially convex and later develops a central depression; in age it becomes even more deeply depressed, becoming somewhat funnel-shaped as the edge of the cap lifts upward.[13] The margin of the cap is rolled inwards when young, but unrolls and elevates as it matures. The cap surface is indigo blue when fresh, but fades to a paler grayish- or silvery-blue, sometimes with greenish splotches. It is often zonate: marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones, and the cap may have dark blue spots, especially towards the edge. Young caps are sticky to the touch.[14]",

The cap surface is smooth but dotted with fine, easily detached scales, and often develops shallow, radial grooves near the margin. The gills are free (not attached to the stem) and are covered by a partial veil when young, which ruptures to leave a fragile, evanescent ring on the stem. Microscopically, the species is distinguished by its thick-walled, ellipsoid spores that are dextrinoid, have a germ pore, and measure around 8\u201312 by 5\u20139 \u03bcm.[11]",

As the mushroom matures, the arms may spread apart. The outer surface of the arms is coated by a brownish, slimy, foul-smelling spore mass called the gleba; its fetid odor helps it attract flies and other insects to assist in spore dispersal.

  "description":"The cap of M. galericulata is roughly conical when young, and eventually becomes broadly bell-shaped or with a broad umbo that can reach diameters of 2\u20134 cm (0.8\u20131.6 in). The cap margin is initially somewhat curved inward, but soon evens out or even becomes uplifted, and often splits radially in age. The surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, and feels greasy but not sticky. The color is somewhat buff-brown on the margin, and fades gradually to pale dirty tan to dirty cinnamon-brown. The flesh is thick in the center of the cap and tapers evenly to the margin, and is watery gray, with a cartilage-like texture. The odor and taste are mildly to strongly farinaceous (similar to the smell of freshly ground flour),[10] to radish-like.[11]",

  "description":"The fruit bodies of Mycena haematopus are the reproductive structures produced by cellular threads or hyphae which grow in rotting wood. The shape of the cap of the fruit body will vary depending on its maturity. Young caps, or \"buttons\", are ovoid (egg-shaped) to conical; later they are campanulate (bell-shaped), and as the fruit body matures, the margins (cap edge) lift upward so that the cap becomes somewhat flat with an umbo (a central nipple-shaped bump).[16] The fully grown cap can reach up to 4 cm (1\n+\n5\u20448 in) in diameter. The surface of the cap initially appears dry and covered with what appears to be a very fine whitish powder, but it soon becomes polished and moist. Mature caps appear somewhat translucent, and develop radial grooves mirroring the position of the gills underneath.[17] The color of the cap is reddish- or pinkish-brown, often tinged with violet, and paler towards the edge. The margin is wavy like the edge of a scallop, and may appear ragged because of lingering remnants of the partial veil.",

  "description":"The cap is light reddish-brown, with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 4.5 cm (0.4 to 1.8 in). Initially conic to bell-shaped to convex, it flattens during maturity, developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap.[8] The margin of the cap has minute but distinct scallops.[9] The surface is moist and smooth, and hygrophanous. The cap frequently develops splits in the margin, or cracks in the disc (the central part of the cap). The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere, grayish to whitish, fragile, and with a slightly mealy odor and taste. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stem (that is, running down the length of the stem) and are a pale brownish color with tinges of red. They are broad (between 3 and 6 mm), and have a close to subdistant spacing, with about 26\u201335 gills reaching the stem.[10] The fragile stem is 3 to 9 cm (1.2 to 3.5 in) long by 0.15 to 0.4 cm (0.06 to 0.16 in) thick and yellow to yellow-brown, becoming reddish-brown to orange-brown in the bottom half in maturity. The lower portion of young stems is covered with white flecks. Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom, the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem.[11] The edibility of the mushroom is \"doubtful\" and consumption \"best avoided\",[9] although it is considered nonpoisonous.[8]",

  "description":"The cap of M. leptocephala is 1\u20133 cm (0.4\u20131.2 in) in diameter, and initially a fat conical shape with the margin pressed close to the stem. As the cap expands, it becomes broadly conic to convex, sometimes broadly bell-shaped, and sometimes convex with a flaring margin. The cap surface has a whitish sheen because of its pruinose coating. The coating gradually sloughs off, leaving the surface smooth and moist. The cap shows radial grooves that outline the position of the gills underneath. Its color is initially dusky brownish-gray to blackish (after the pruinose coating has sloughed off), soon fading from dark to light gray and finally ashy-gray. The flesh is thin and fragile, grayish, and has a slightly sour (acidulous) taste, and a weakly alkaline odor that strengthens in intensity if the flesh is crushed. The gills are narrow, equal in width throughout, ascending-adnate (the gills attach at much less than a right angle, appearing to curve upward toward stem) and toothed. They are subdistantly spaced, with 18\u201327 gills reaching the stem, and one or two tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) interspersed between them.

It may have several concentric ridges or zones. Fresh fruit bodies range in color from yellowish-orange to buff to cinnamon; when dried they may be various shades of tan, brown or clay. The faded colors of dried fruit bodies tend to revive when moistened. On the underside of the cap, the gills are narrow and spaced closely together, often forked, buff-colored, and with numerous interconnecting cross-veins.

The \"egg\" ranges in color from whitish to buff to reddish-brown, measures up to 6 cm (2.4 in) in diameter, and usually has a thick mycelial cord attached at the bottom.[16] As the mushroom matures, the pressure caused by the enlargement of the internal structures cause the peridium to tear and the fruit body rapidly emerges from the \"egg\". The mature mushroom is up to 25 cm (9.8 in) tall and girded with a net-like structure called the indusium (or less technically a \"skirt\") that hangs down from the conical to bell-shaped cap. The netlike openings of the indusium may be polygonal or round in shape.[20] Well-developed specimens have an indusium that reaches to the volva and flares out somewhat before collapsing on the stalk.[21] The cap is 1.5\u20134 cm (0.6\u20131.6 in) wide and its reticulated (pitted and ridged) surface is covered with a layer of greenish-brown and foul-smelling slime, the gleba, which initially partially obscures the reticulations.

Microscopically, the cap surfaces comprises minute cells and cavities, with a spongy structure similar to that of the stem, but with smaller perforations than the stem.[4] The lower margin of the cap is free from attachment to the stalk, and there is sometimes a membranous veil suspended like a collar around the stem under the cap; the veil can be of varying lengths.[13] This veil can be seen in dissected eggs where it is present as a distinct, thin membranous tissue between the stalk and the cap before expansion. In this form, the veil is continuous from its attachment with the \"primordial tissue\"[nb 1] at the base of the stalk and volva below to the tip of the stem at the point where it joins the cap. The veil produced in P. ravenelli is distinct from the flaring, net-like indusium produced by Phallus species like P. indusiatus.[14] Gleba covers the head and is olive-green to dark brown in color, slimy in texture, and foul smelling. The spores measure 3 to 4.5 \u00b5m by 1 to 2 \u00b5m, are colorless, elliptical in shape, and smooth in texture.[11][12] They are thin-walled and covered with a thin, hyaline (transparent), sticky coating.[15]",

All parts turn dark grey on aging or bruising.[3] The smell is fruity and the spore print is pale ochre, and the oval warty spores average 9.5 x 8 \u03bcm.[4] The edible but acrid Russula ochroleuca resembles this species, but has a duller yellow cap.[5]",

  "description":"Described by mushroom enthusiast Antonio Carluccio as \"not exactly nice to look at\", the cap is at first dome or barrel-shaped, becoming convex and flattened with age with a diameter of up to 15 cm (6 in). The cap center is often depressed.[15] The cuticle of the cap is green, most profoundly in the center, with patches of the same color dispersed radially around the center in an areolate pattern.[13] The color of the cuticle is often of variable shade, ranging from gray to verdigris to grass-green. The extent of the patching of the cuticle is also variable, giving specimens with limited patches a resemblance to other green-capped species of Russula, such as R. aeruginea. The green patches of the cap lie on a white to pale green background. The cap, while frequently round, may also exhibit irregular lobes and cracks. The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to a distance of about halfway towards the cap center.[13] The gills are white to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mostly free from attachment to the stipe. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins.[16] The stipe is cylindrical, white, and of variable height, up to 8 cm (3 in) tall and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide;[17] it is roughly the same thickness at both the top and the base. The top portion of the stipe may be farinose\u2014covered with a white, mealy powder.[18] It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling.[19] Like other mushrooms in the Russulales, the flesh is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture\u2014cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous hyphae present in other orders of the basidiomycota.[20]",

The cap color is variable, ranging from dingy yellow to yellowish-orange to ochraceous-salmon, cinnamon-brown or olive-brown to yellow-brown. The flesh is pale orange-yellow to orange-buff or orange, and does not stain when exposed to air. The odor and taste are not distinctive.

Glandular dots are made of clumps of pigmented cells, and, unlike reticulation or scabers (small visible tufts of fibers that occur on the stems of other Suillus species), can be rubbed off with handling. The flesh is ochraceous to yellowish, often salmon-orange at the base of the stem. The partial veil that protects the developing gills is initially thick, baggy, and rubbery. It often has a conspicuously thickened cottony roll of tissue at its base, and sometimes flares outward from the stem on the lower portion. It forms a gelatinous ring on the upper to middle part of the stem. The spore print is cinnamon-brown to brown.[12] The surface of the cap, when applied with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) or ammonia solution (chemical reagents commonly used for mushroom identification), will first turn a fleeting pink color, then dark red as the flesh collapses.[19]",

The most colorful specimens occur in warm humid weather.[12] Older specimens are often paler.[17]",

  "description":"The shape of the cap is initially convex before later becoming broadly convex to eventually flattened in maturity; the diameter of the cap is typically between 3 and 15 cm (1.2 and 5.9 in). The cap surface is dry, with a velvet-like texture, although in age it can become rimose (developing a network of cracks and small crevices). The cap color is initially black to dark grayish brown; young specimens can have a whitish bloom (resembling a dusting of fine powder) on the surface.[17] Fruit bodies, especially young specimens, tend to be free of maggots and other insect larvae.[18] As the mushroom matures, the bloom disappears and the color fades to become grayish to grayish brown.[18] The cap flesh is whitish, but after it is cut or injured, it will stain pink to reddish gray, and eventually turn black.[17]",

  "description":"The cap of this species grows up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter,[5] though some North American specimens reach 30 cm (12 in) across.[2] Grey-yellow to pale- or walnut-brown, it is slightly downy at first and later becomes smooth with a matte lustre. It is initially convex before flattening out with maturity.[5] The cap skin does not peel away from the flesh.[18] The pores underneath are white at first and become pinkish with maturity. They are adnate to the stalk and bulge downwards as the mushroom ages.[19] The pores bruise carmine or brownish,[20] often developing rusty-brown spots with age,[21] and number about one or two per millimetre.[16] The tubes are long relative to the size of the cap, measuring 2\u20133 cm (0.8\u20131.2 in) deep in the middle part of the cap.[21] The stalk is initially bulbous before stretching and thinning in the upper part; the lower part of the stalk remains swollen, sometimes shrinking at the base where it attaches to the substrate.[21] It measures 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in)\u2014rarely to 20 cm (7.9 in)[2]\u2014tall, and 2\u20133 cm (0.8\u20131.2 in) wide, and can bulge out to 6 cm (2.4 in) across at the base.[19] It is lighter in colour than the cap, and covered with a coarse brown network of markings,[19] which have been likened to fishnet stockings in appearance.[20] Described as \"very appetising\" in appearance,[22] the flesh is white or creamy, and pink beneath the cap cuticle; the flesh can also develop pinkish tones where it has been cut.[23] It has a slight smell,[18] which has been described as pleasant,[5][24] as well as faintly unpleasant.[19][20] The flesh is softer than that of other boletes,[20] and tends to become more spongy as the mushroom matures.[21] Insects rarely infest this species.[18]",

  "description":"The cap of the fruit body is 7 to 15 cm (2.8 to 5.9 in) in diameter, initially convex in shape but becoming centrally depressed, with a broadly arched and rounded margin.[7] Young specimens are rather hard and firm, and the cap has a finely velvet-textured surface that soon wears off to become smooth.[2] The color of the fruit body is violet when young, but dulls as it ages, becoming a dull violet-purplish-gray, then eventually chocolate-brown at maturity. The flesh is solid, white, and does not change color when cut or bruised. The taste is bitter, and the odor is not distinctive.[7] Mycologist David Arora calls the mushroom \"beautiful, but bitter-tasting\".[8]",
