Agaricus bisporus		['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/ChampignonMushroom.jpg/220px-ChampignonMushroom.jpg']	"The pileus or cap of the original wild species is a pale grey-brown in color, with broad, flat scales on a paler background and fading toward the margins. It is first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity, and 5–10 centimetres (2–4 inches) in diameter. The narrow, crowded gills are free and initially, pink, then red-brown and finally a dark brown with a whitish edge from the cheilocystidia. The cylindrical stipe is up to 6 cm (2

1⁄2 in) tall by 1–2 cm (1⁄2–3⁄4 in) wide and bears a thick and narrow ring, which may be streaked on the upper side. The firm flesh is white, although stains a pale pinkish-red on bruising.[12][13] The spore print is dark brown. The spores are oval to round and measure approximately 4.5–5.5 μm × 5–7.5 μm, and the basidia usually two-spored, although two-tetrasporic varieties have been described from the Mojave Desert and the Mediterranean, with predominantly heterothallic and homothallic lifestyles, respectively.[14][15]"	True	ring	convex	False		free	['brown']		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus_bisporus
Pleurotus ostreatus		['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f6/Pleurotus_ostreatus_JPG7.jpg/220px-Pleurotus_ostreatus_JPG7.jpg']	"The mushroom has a broad, fan or oyster-shaped cap spanning 2–30 cm (3⁄4–11
+
3⁄4 in);[6] natural specimens range from white to gray or tan to dark-brown; the margin is inrolled when young, and is smooth and often somewhat lobed or wavy. The flesh is white, firm, and varies in thickness due to stipe arrangement. The gills of the mushroom are white to cream, and descend on the stalk if present. If so, the stipe is off-center with a lateral attachment to wood. The spore print of the mushroom is white to lilac-gray, and best viewed on dark background. The mushroom's stipe is often absent. When present, it is short and thick."	True	gills	offset	False		decurrent	['white']		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleurotus_ostreatus
Agaricus abruptibulbus		['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Agaricus_abruptibulbus.jpg/220px-Agaricus_abruptibulbus.jpg']	The cap is up to 8 cm (3.1 in) in diameter, convex in shape, sometimes with an umbo, and whitish in color. After being scratched or bruised, the cap turns yellow. The stipe is 8–12 cm (3.1–4.7 in) long by 1–3 cm (0.39–1.18 in) thick and bulbous. A large, white annular ring is present on the stipe. The gill attachment is free, and the color is initially grayish but turns brownish after the spores are developed. Specimens smell slightly of anise. The spore print is brown to purple-brown. Spores are elliptical in shape, and are 6–8 by 4–5 µm.

The cap surface is dry, smooth, reddish-brown to coco-brown with silky fibrils or sometimes with flattened scales and often has a slight umbo. In maturity, the fibrils usually darken to walnut brown. The flesh is light brown and does not change color in KOH. When bruised or injured, the flesh turns bright red within 30 seconds, and later fades to brown.

Agaricus silvaticus		['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Agasil0big.jpg/220px-Agasil0big.jpg']	The greyish-brown cap is hemispherical when young, but later flattens out up to 10 cm in diameter. It is covered with broad scales. The gills are grey when young, and become much darker with age. The spores are chocolate brown. The stem is brownish, often with a hanging ring and a small bulb at the base.[1] The flesh is white with a mild taste, turning reddish when cut.

Agaricus pattersoniae		['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/Agaricus_pattersoniae_133001.jpg/220px-Agaricus_pattersoniae_133001.jpg']	The cap, 5–19 cm (2.0–7.5 in) in diameter, is initially almost hemispherical in shape, transforming to broadly convex and finally to flattened or with edges upturned in age. The cap surface is dry, with fibrils when young, but later the fibrils form large, dark brown appressed squamules (2–9 mm long by 2–5 mm broad). The cap color may be various shades of brown depending on the maturity of the specimen. The cap flesh is typically 1–3 cm (0.4–1.2 in) thick, firm, white, and stains deep red 20–30 seconds after injury or bruising. The odor immediately after cutting is mild, faintly spicy, but several minutes may be described as 'fruity'.

Agaricus placomyces		['https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Agaricus_placomyces.jpg/220px-Agaricus_placomyces.jpg']	Agaricus placomyces has a cap that is 5–12 cm and varies from convex to broadly convex or nearly flat in age. In addition, the surface of the cap is dry and covered with brownish fibers and scales, especially over the center. Underneath, the cap can be whitish under normal environments, or pinkish in wet weather. Covered with fine, appressed greyish-brown scales and concentrated at the disc, the cap is thick, slowly becoming vinaceous when injured; the odor smells of phenol.[1] The flesh is white, and becomes yellow when placed in KOH.[citation needed]	True	ring	convex	False		free	['blackish-brown']		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaricus_placomyces
