Now, you can open the main file and press run all but *warning*
It will run for 15 hours scraping the web for all the mushrooms in our list


### Structures
- mushroom objects with characteristic traits
- small functions to find specific parts when given a specific websitee
- one main function that scrapes one page and searches for all the parts in the page
- and an overall function that goes through the list and calls the sub functions for each page
